Natural Language Precessing - Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews with Machine Learning.

Sentiment Analysis: It is a general definition given to the processes of defining and classifying the opinions or expressions specified by a piece of text through various algorithms in order to evaluate the attitude of a writer or a post towards a particular topic positively and negatively. Normally, the concept of sentiment analysis worldwide is also dealing with neutral opinion, but I will not take this into account.
Sentiment analysis is generally seen as a study on tweets around the world. In addition, emotional analysis can be made with people's opinions about films, products and companies. I will conduct an sentiment analysis on the criticism in the data set, which contains criticisms of the movies in IMDB. I will try to show the answer to the important things such as which classifiers we can work with, we can approach higher accuracy, what type of vector transformation we can do, and the word ratios are more useful for me.
